## System Behavior


## Design Alternatives
One choice we had to make in the construction of this project was the use of a positional servo motor over a continuous servo motor. We chose to use the positional servo motor because of its ability to rotate to a precise 67Â° angle as specified in the project requirements. One downside to using the positional servo compared to the continuous servo is that it is not easy to change the speed of the rotation of the motor. We decided that the ability to achieve a precise angle outweighs the ability to easily change the speed of rotation.
